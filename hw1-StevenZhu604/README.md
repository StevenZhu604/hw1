# Homework 1

This homework involves implementing a custom Linked List, and using Linked Lists to solve some practice problems!

The format is very similar to Homework 0. There are 2 parts: the first part is in the `DataStructures` folder, and the second part is in `Practice`. There are no hidden tests for this homework; if you pass all of the tests in both `DataStructuresTests` and `PracticeTests`, you'll get full credit!

**Unlike Homework 0, we will now be introducing GitHub Classroom as tool to help you manage your submissions.** Please use this link to get started: https://classroom.github.com/a/6uuQe6ff

Once your personal repository is generated, you can do your work in it! As a reminder of how to use Git:
1. Clone your repository to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/atdp-dse/hw1-YOURUSERNAMEHERE` (replace with your username).
2. To save your work to GitHub, remember the sequence `git add .`, `git commit -m"YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"`, and `git push`. **Commit small changes often!** 
3. Once you're ready to submit, go to Gradescope where there should be an option to submit with GitHub. After connecting your GitHub account, your homework repository should show up at the top. You can simply select it and Gradescope will automatically run the tests on your code.
